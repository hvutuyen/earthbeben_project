# earthbeben_project

This was a project in university where we build an infopage about earthquakes and my first approached to work in the field of web development.
The main focus of this project was to automatically get data with an USGS earthquake data API and visualise them on a map. For that I wrote a simple script, in which the data gets processed.
Since learning python during my studies, i wanted to use the Flask framework.
We also managed to deploy the page on heroku (https://earthbeben-geomediengestaltung.herokuapp.com/).

My partner created a simple template with some information about earthquakes. We linked the map to an iFrame, which I heard is not the way to do it.
But since it was our first Webapp we were fine with our results :)
